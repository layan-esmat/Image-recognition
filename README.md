## Task Instructions

- Train an image classification model using **Teachable Machine** by Google.
- Use at least **three classes**: `car`, `motorcycle`, and `bicycle`.
- Upload image samples for each class.
- Train the model using Teachable Machine.
- Evaluate the model using test images.
- Export the trained model in **TensorFlow â†’ Keras** format.
- Write a **Python script** to:
  - Load the trained model.
  - Accept an input image.
  - Predict the class (`car`, `motorcycle`, or `bicycle`).
- Submit the following:
  - Python classification script.
  - Exported model files.
  - Screenshot of the model in action (as shown above).

## What I Did

- Collected and uploaded:
  - **64** images for the `car` class.
  - **80** images for the `motorcycle` class.
  - **61** images for the `bicycle` class.
- Trained the model using Teachable Machine.
- Exported the model in **Keras** format.
- Tested the model using a photo of a car and achieved **100% accuracy**.
- Created a Python script to classify new images using the model.

## Tools Used

- [Teachable Machine by Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Python (with necessary ML and image libraries)

## How to Use the Model

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Python script and pass the path of the input image.
4. View the predicted vehicle class.
